\Question{Divisible or Not}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that for any number $n$, the number formed by the last two digits of $n$ are divisible by 4 if and only if $n$ is divisible by 4. (For example, '23xx' is divisible by 4 if and only if the number 'xx' is divisible by 4.)
\item Prove that for any number $n$, the sum of the digits of $n$ are divisible by 3 if and only if $n$ is divisible by 3.
